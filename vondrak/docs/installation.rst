Installation
============

There is only one dependency for Vondrak, `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_. You can install with ``pip3 install numpy``. You can install Vondrak as well with the standard Python package tool. For Python 2, use ``pip``.

    ``pip3 install vondrak``

Alternatively, clone the repo ``git clone https://github.com/dreamalligator/vondrak``, and install from source with ``python3 setup.py install``.

If you have any problems with installation, or would like to suggest an improvement, simply create an issue on the project's Github page:

Cheers!
